# a_little_about_me

First design spec for FrontEnd portfolio, subject: 'About Me' using CSS animation and simple design spec

Things learnt: Normalize.css reset file, better than CSS resets, plus CSS3 animation/ keyframes/ transitions elements, while not as good as JavaScript they are becoming more browser compatable and are good for simpler UX/UI aspects
